# Spring Boot JPA Practice Project

This repository contains my **practice code while learning Spring Boot and JPA/Hibernate**.  
The main goal of this project is to understand how **entity relationships** work, especially **Many-to-Many**, along with **One-to-Many** and **One-to-One** mappings.

This is **not a production project** — it’s a learning sandbox where I experiment with JPA annotations, Hibernate behavior, and basic CRUD operations using the DAO pattern.

---

## What I’m Practicing Here

- Spring Boot + JPA / Hibernate basics
- Entity relationships:
  - Many-to-Many (e.g., Student ↔ Course)
  - One-to-Many (e.g., Course ↔ Review)
  - One-to-One (e.g., Instructor ↔ InstructorDetail)
- CRUD operations using DAO layer
- Annotations like `@Entity`, `@ManyToMany`, `@OneToMany`, `@OneToOne`, etc.
- Understanding cascading and fetching behavior

---

## Entities Used

- Student  
- Course  
- Instructor  
- InstructorDetail  
- Review  

These are used to model common database relationship scenarios in JPA.

---

## Tech Stack

- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- JPA / Hibernate  
- Maven  

(Database depends on local configuration)

---

## Purpose

- Practice JPA and Hibernate concepts
- Improve understanding of Spring Boot project structure
- Keep learning and experimenting
- Maintain GitHub activity while building consistency 🚀

---

## Note

This project is for **learning and practice only**.  
Code structure and patterns may change as I learn more and improve.
